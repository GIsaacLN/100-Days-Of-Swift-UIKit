# 💯 100 Days of Swift – UIKit Edition

This repository contains my complete journey through the [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) course by Paul Hudson, which focuses on mastering Swift using UIKit.

## 📘 About the Course

The **100 Days of Swift** is a free coding challenge from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), aimed at helping developers build strong Swift fundamentals through hands-on UIKit projects and challenges.

Throughout the course, I covered:

- Core Swift concepts: variables, functions, structs, classes, closures, protocols, error handling, and more
- UIKit fundamentals: storyboards, Auto Layout, view controllers, navigation, and animations
- Project-based learning: building complete iOS apps with UIKit and practical problem solving

## 📁 Repo Structure

This repo is organized by days and projects:

- Full Xcode projects from each milestone  
- Custom code and improvements where applicable  

## 🏅 Certificate of Merit

After completing all 100 days, I received a Certificate of Merit from Hacking with Swift.
